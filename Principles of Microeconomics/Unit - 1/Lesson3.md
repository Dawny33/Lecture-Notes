### Elasticity

- Elasticity: The elasticity of supply and demand is how much do supply and demand respond to the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded, when the price changes.
    - How elastic is demand? means how sensitive is price to the amount of quantity demanded? or What is the slope(sensitivity) of the demand curve?
- When there is no substitutes, demand would be perfectly inelastic.
- When there are infinite, perfect substitutes, demand would be perfectly elastic.
- Price elasticity of demand(epsilon) = (% change in quantity) / (% change in price)
- When perfectly inelastic, eps = 0. When perfectly elastic, eps = -Inf
- Revenue = Price * Quantity
- d(Revenue)/d(Price) = Quantity + ( d(Quantity)/d(Price) )  => d(Revenue)/d(Price) = Quantity * (1 + Elasticity)
    - Which means if elasticity is between 0 and -1, then raising prices will raise revenues
    - If E > -1, then raising prices would lower revenue.
- Empirical Economics: Estimating these type of elasticities.
- For measuring the elasticity of demand, move along a (single) demand curve for calculating change and not across demand curves.
    - Cause, if we move across demand curves for estimating the difference between the equilibrium points (e2` - e2), we are actually moving along the supply curve, which means we are estimating elasticity of supply.
- Individuals often choose the price they face.

    - Example: Making people pay for medical care, so that it can affect their demand for it. Like copayments.
    - So, the healthier people would choose plans where they would be paying more.
    - So, the effect is determined by randomized trial experiments, in order to make it causal.And that’s how the causation vs correlation problem can be solved.
    - Rand’s health insurance experiment: Randomly selected two groups of people. One group have complete health insure, and  the other didn’t. They found out that health insurance’s demand is ~0.2 (elastic). So, when the price goes up, people use less medical care, but not that much less.
    - But, when a person with health insurance is stripped off it, then his medical demand fell by 45%
    - So, it is not that prices do not matter, but they mater very less.
    - Is it good or not? It has been found that people were no more sicker when they used less medicine due to price hike. Which means that people waste most of the health care. So, the conclusion can be that we can charge people for using health care, with no or very less downside.
