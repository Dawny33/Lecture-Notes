Notes from the book **Devops Hiring**, by Dave Zwieback

- Identifying the good polymaths/generalists/comb-shaped people is  to through their non-linear career paths and wide-ranging interests.

 - Outsourcing recruiting is a bad practise (cause either the candidate’s salary is inflated for a better %age, else deflated for a faster deal closure).

- Referrals from employees’ networks is a very effective way.

 - Also, presenting at confs. meet ups and blogging also are very effective methods for increasing team’s visibility to potential candidates.

- A great manager would be a huge reason for candidates to come and stay. They excel at engaging the candidate right from the beginning.

 - A key attribute for Devops hiring can be the emphasis on measurement and metrics.

 - Sharing both the successes and failures (postmortems), often publicly, is one of the hallmarks of the DevOps movement.
